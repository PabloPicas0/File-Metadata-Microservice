# File-Metadata-Microservice

A simple file metadata microservice that after file upload shows file name, type, and size in bytes within the JSON response.

This project is my solution for [APIs and Microservices Projects - URL Shortener Microservice] and it's a part of APIs and Microservices Certification by [freeCodeCamp].

## Requirements
✅ You should provide your own project, not the example URL.
✅ You can submit a form that includes a file upload.
✅ The form file input field has the name attribute set to upfile.
✅ When you submit a file, you receive the file name, type, and size in bytes within the JSON response.
